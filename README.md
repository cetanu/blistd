# blistd <sup>DNS Blacklist Lookup</sup>

## About

This is a script written in Python which checks each DNS Blacklist to see if your IP has been listed.  


## Features

- Automatically downloads a list of DNSBLs from [here](https://gist.github.com/cetanu/9697771)
- Email alerting via SMTP
- Logging
- Randomized wait between executions so that we don't look too much like robots to the DNSBL hosts
