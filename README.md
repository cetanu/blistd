# blistd <sup>DNS Blacklist Lookup</sup>

---

## About

This is a Powershell script which checks each DNS Blacklist to see if your IP has been listed.  

## Features

- Pretty console output colours
- Randomized wait between executions so that we don't look like robots to the DNSBL hosts
- Email alerting via SMTP

## Contributing

This is a basic script and it works as it is... but if you want to improve it or make it cleaner, feel free.
